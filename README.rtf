I made a wedding website for my mom and her new husband. 

Feel free to edit/reuse/whatever this code with proper credits (to me and the folks I credit).  

If you'd like to read the website, try looking at JudithAndBart.com.  If that domain name has expired, you can find a backup on my MIT website: http://ruth_b.scripts.mit.edu/JB/
